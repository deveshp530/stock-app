A stock app where users can look for stocks and add to their portfolio.
Users can look for friends/ other users who use the app by name or email.
Used Iexcloud API to get stock data


# Purpose
Was always curious on how Robinhood and decided to make my own version of it. You cannot buy stocks, but you can look for stocks and add them to your portfolio to be invested in real life later on. So instead of searching for it, you have it ready here.
